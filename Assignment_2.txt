1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans:- the two values of the Boolean data type True and False.
      bool True,bool False
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans:- AND ,OR,NOT
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans:- AND 
      True and False ---> False      True and True   ---> True
      False and False ---> False      False and True ---> False 
      OR
      True or False --->  True     True or True   ---> True
      False or False ---> False       False or True --->   True
      NOT
      not True --> True
      not False ---> False
    
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
Ans.:-  (5 > 4) and (3 == 5) --> False
        not (5 > 4) --> False
        (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) --> True
        not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
        (True and True) and (True == False) --> False
        (not False) or (not True) --> True
5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans:-  > (greter than), >= (greater than or equal to) ,<= (less than or equal to) ,< (less than),= (equal to) ,!=  (not equal to)
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Ans:- assignment operators :- It assigns a particular value to a variable. a=10,b=20
      equal to :- it assign for a comparison of two number ex:- x==y, a==b,10==20
      
7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

Ans:- first blocks 
     if spam == 10:
        print('eggs')
    second block of code
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    thirs block of code
    print('spam')
    print('spam')
        
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans:- spam = int(input("enter a number"));
      if spam==1:
        print("Hello");
      elif spam==2:
        print("Howdy");
      else:
        print("Greetings")


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
Ans:- Ctrl+C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans:- break :- if the given condition is true then it will break from the loop/ or exit and give the output
      continue:- if the given condition is true then it will skip the condition and execute the code

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)? 
Ans:- range(10) - When we call range(10) with one argument, user will get a series of numbers that starts at 0 and includes every whole number up to, but not including, the given stop number
that user have provided as the stop
range(0, 10) - When we call range(0,10) with two argument, user to decide not only where the series of numbers stops but also where it starts, so user don’t have to start at 0 all the time. 
range(0, 10, 1) - When the user call range(0,10,1) with three arguments the user can choose not only where the series of numbers will start and stop but also how big the difference will be between one number and the next.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans:-n=1;
    while n<=10:
        print(n);
        n=n+1;

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Ans:- spam. bacon()
