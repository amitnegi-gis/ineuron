1. What exactly is []?
Ans:---> This is a empty list.

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Ans ---> spam[2] = 'hello'


Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.
3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
Ans ---> d

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
Ans ---> d

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
Ans ---> ['a', 'b']

Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.
6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Ans ---> 1 

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans ---> [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
Ans ---> [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Ans:--->The operator for list concatenation is +
    while the operator for replication is *. 
    
    
10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Ans:---> Appens() : - Appends without any change as a single element to the end of the list.
      insert() :-  insert can be used to insert a value at any desired position.
      
11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Ans:---> remove() and pop()

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Ans:--->Lists are mutable but Strings are immutable. 
        elements of a list can be of different types whereas a String only contains characters that are all of String type.

13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
Ans--> Lists are mutable but tuples are immutable. list is in [ ](square bracket) and tuple is in ( ) (parenthesis) 
        
14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
Ans ---> (42)

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
Ans ---> a=[20,30,40,'amit']
         to convert this in tuple-- tuple(a)
         b= (20,30,40,'amit')
         to convert this in list-- list(b)

16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?
Ans:---> Variables will contain references to list values rather than list values themselves.

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Ans-->  copy.copy():--A  copy means constructing a new collection object and then populating it with references to the child objects found in the original.
    copy.deepcopy() :-- Deep copy is a process in which the copying process occurs recursively. It means first constructing a new collection object and then recursively populating it with copies of the child objects found in the original.
